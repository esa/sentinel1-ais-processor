AIS_receiver - executable:
Performs the demodulation and detection for a single channel raw AIS data.
Initially developed under TEC-ESC and adapted to the Sentinel-1 data.

Executed as:
./AIS_receiver <data_len> <outputFile> <inputWavfile>
Where	
	<data_len>  168 for heritage AIS Channels and 96 for SAT AIS Channels
	<outputFile> Output directory and txt file to save AIS detections
	<inputWavfile> Two channel Wav file containing the RAW complex AIS data sampled at 9600*3
The executable loads the following files:
//   <h1_file> low-pass filter description file
//   <h2_file> matched-filter description file: oversampled filter matched to the principal pulse of the Laurent decomposition
//   <h3_file> low-pass filter(zonal) description file
//   <h4_file> low-pass filter(mod.Meng.Mor. frequency estim.) description file
//   <pulse_file> pulse description file
//   <error_files> error correction files
Note that the program must be executed in the source directory (i.e. "./AIS_receiver"") in order to correctly read the error files.
The source code is located in the folder '/src/ESA_AIS_receiver_code/'

Testcase:
./AIS_receiver 168 ch0_testcase_result.txt ch0_testcase.wav

Result: Should take around 34 seconds and generate the file ch0_testcase_result.txt with the binary message detections.
