AIS_receiver - executable:
Performs the demodulation and detection for multiple AIS channels in parallel.
Initially developed under TEC-ESC and adapted to the Sentinel-1 data.

Executed as:
./AIS_receiver <output_directory> <input .asc file1>...<input .asc fileN> <data_len1>....<data_lenN>
Where	
//	 <output_directory> Output directory where output .txt files will be saved.
//	 <input .asc files> text files containing the RAW (real, image)  AIS data sampled at 9600*3
//   <data_lens>  Expected bit length for the channel to process. 168 for heritage AIS Channels and 96 for SAT AIS Channels
//
The executable loads the following files:
//   <h1_file> low-pass filter description file
//   <h2_file> matched-filter description file: oversampled filter matched to the principal pulse of the Laurent decomposition
//   <h3_file> low-pass filter(zonal) description file
//   <h4_file> low-pass filter(mod.Meng.Mor. frequency estim.) description file
//   <pulse_file> pulse description file
//   <error_files> error correction files
Note that the program must be executed in the source directory (i.e. "./AIS_receiver"") in order to correctly read the error files.
The source code is located in the folder '/src/ESA_AIS_receiver_code/'

Testcase:
./AIS_receiver ./outputdir /ch0_testcase.asc 168

Result: Should take around 34 seconds and generate the file ch0_testcase_result.txt with the binary message detections.
